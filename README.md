# Web Scraping & Data Handling Challenge

This project demonstrates how to scrape movie and TV show data from [JustWatch](https://www.justwatch.com/in/movies?release_year_from=2000) using Python. It covers web scraping, data cleaning, filtering, analysis, and exporting results for further use.

## Features

- **Scraping:** Gathers movie and TV show details (title, year, genres, IMDb rating, streaming services, URL, etc.).
- **Filtering:** Keeps only recent (last 2 years) and highly-rated (IMDb 7+) titles.
- **Analysis:** Computes average ratings, top genres, and most frequent streaming services.
- **Export:** Saves filtered data to CSV for further processing.

## Repository Contents

- `Web_Scraping.ipynb` â€” The original Colab notebook.
- Sample outputs: `movie.csv`, `tv.csv` (generated when running the script).

## Example Dataset

See CSV outputs in [this Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1cYQBrVvTwezfpCJvexvyPKZDFYvwCasP?usp=sharing).

## Disclaimer

- This project is for educational purposes.
- Scraping should respect website terms of service.
- Adapt the script if JustWatch changes their HTML or uses dynamic content.
